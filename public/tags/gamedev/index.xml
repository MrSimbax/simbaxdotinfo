      <description>Having beaten SOMA recently, I was curiously delving into the story, admiring the gorgeous, thoughtful, detailed, realistic environments created by Frictional Games, when I realized how much work and love must be put into the process of game developing. It took them nearly five years to finally release a masterfully crafted masterpiece in science fiction storytelling and horror genre. Not only did they spend this time on the game itself, but also on the whole behind-the-scenes background being a great appendix to the plot.</description>
